                            </br>
                            StaWeb was founded in 2010 with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a platform that simplifies complex
                            processes for businesses and individuals alike. What started as a small startup with big dreams quickly gained
                            traction as our innovative solutions began to resonate with users.</p>
                            </br>
